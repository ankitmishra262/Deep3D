# Deep3D

This is an implementation (under progress) of the paper **Deep3D: Fully Automatic 2D-to-3D Video Conversion with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks** (https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03650)

**Installation details**

For usage of a NVidia card with CUDA 9.0, I use the following. Generally using a Anaconda environment is a good idea.

1. Tensorflow

`pip install tensorflow-gpu`

2. Pytorch 

`pip install torch torchvision`
